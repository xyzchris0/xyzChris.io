            <h1>About</h1>
            
            <p style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.6;">Hello, my name is Chris, and I've been part of the InfoSec community for over 7 years. Throughout my career, I've held diverse roles, including serving as the Lead Information System Security Officer in the defense sector and working as a Cyber Operations Analyst. Currently, I am a Cyber Technical Program Manager/Security Engineer, focusing on developing Assessment solution tools for a broad stakeholder base.

                I hold several professional certifications, including the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) and the CompTIA Security+ certification. My expertise lies in stakeholder relationship building, technical analysis, and project management.
                
                Although my primary focus has been on Cybersecurity, I have a keen interest in Data analytics, DevSecOps, and Machine Learning.
                
                Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further information.</p>
