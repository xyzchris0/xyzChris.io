            <h1>How to learn the Basics of Cybersecurity from Scratch</h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">
                I've been working in Cybersecurity for over 6 years now, and if I had ChatGPT and all the other services, it would have made the process so much faster! When I first started, there was only Offensive Security and SANS-related training for new Cybersecurity professionals that wished to break into the field. But now, there are various platforms that you can use for self-studying. Currently, you have TryHackMe, TheCyberMentors certifications, HackTheBox, and even eLearnSecurity. If I could give advice to new Cybersecurity professionals that are wanting to enter the field and can't afford some of the higher-priced platforms, it would be the following:
            </p>
            
            
            <h2>Phase 0</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">
                Start off using the TryHackMe platform. The barrier to entry here is very low; back in the day, you had to spin up your own environment, but with TryHackMe, you can use a web-hosted Kali instance. The "Complete Beginner Training" should be your first stop. It's decently priced, and you can see if security is something that you are interested in. While Cybersecurity is an amazing field, I don't believe people should drop thousands of dollars on training if they aren't interested in it. As you start this process, check out the various job opportunities within the Cybersecurity field.
            </p>
            
            <p style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.6;">The field of Cybersecurity has been changing extremely fast over the past 5 years. With the rise of AI assistive tools, the barrier to enter has never been easier for new talent but also raising the skill level of bad actors that can use these techniques to increase their Threat activities.</p>
            <h2>Phase 1</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">
                After going through the Complete beginner path on TryHackMe, I would recommend that you learn the basics of Linux and Python (or another programming language). Let's be clear here, when I say know a programming language, I mean enough to understand basic syntax and write a quick script. With so many new programmers now using things like ChatGPT/Co-pilot and the other tools, what we saw in the last decade of bad written code is only going to get worse. We are more interested in speed than we are in security. This though will reach a point where security/speed are in lock-step but I believe we are about 5-7 years off from that. Another piece of this is understanding Linux. The world runs on Linux, whether you want to dual-boot or have it as your main operating system. You need to get familiar with using Linux on a daily basis. There are various platforms that you can go about learning these 2 items. But stick with Free-tools first before dropping serious cash on anything. The Freecodecamp has some great beginner Python courses you can take. If you are not a visual learner then head over to the <a href="https://mooc.fi/en/" target="_blank">Mooc.fi</a> Python course, and you can do problem sets. After you have a basic understanding of the key fundamentals of Python, I would set aside 1 weekend maybe 2, to try 1 project. That can be guided or by yourself.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">
                The <a href="https://replit.com/" target="_blank">replit.com</a> site is amazing for spinning up quick projects so you don't have to build your own infrastructure. Next, switch over to an understanding of Linux. Yes, there are various Linux certifications, but unless you are aiming for the RedHat Certifications, most don't have a good ROI. The <a href="https://linuxjourney.com/" target="_blank">Linux Journey</a> is a great one-stop-shop for understanding Linux commands.
            </p>
            <h2>Phase 2</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">
                Now that you have the basics down (Yes I skipped Networking, it's there, it's a thing; I personally think Networking can be wrapped up in this phase since people seem to hate it). Certifications, the thing that has been driving the Cybersecurity Job market for over 20 years. You probably have heard of the CISSP or the CISM or even the CISM. Certifications seem to be on the out for newer roles; this is a result of a few factors. There has been an increase in entry-level or low-level skilled employees snagging multiple higher-level certifications, diluting the value. I will be blunt here, if you don't have a few years in the field, then your focus shouldn't be getting the CISSP. Instead, focus on a more general Certification for your focused area. If you are going Cloud, look at the CCSK or one of the AWS Certifications. If you are going the Pentest route, look into TheCyberMentors Certifications, and if you want to go into GovTech, look at the CompTIA Security+ Certification.
            </p>
            <h2>Phase 3</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">
                Start off using the TryHackMe platform. The barrier to entry here is very low; back in the day, you had to spin up your own environment, but with TryHackMe, you can use a web-hosted Kali instance.
